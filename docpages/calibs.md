# 1. Calibrations included

`D47calib` provides the following pre-built calibrations:

##### **`breitenbach_2018`:**
Cave pearls analyzed by [Breitenbach et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2018.03.010).

Raw data were obtained from the original study’s supplementary information. The original publication processed data according to two sessions, each 4-5 months long, separated by 2 months. After reprocessing the original raw data using D47crunch, visual inspection of the standardization residuals defined revealed the presence of substantial drifts in both sessions. We thus assigned modified session boundaries defining four continuous measurement periods separated by 21 to 52 days, with new session lengths ranging from 24 to 80 days. The original data was not modified in any other way. Formation temperatures are from table 1 of the original study. We assigned arbitrary 95 % uncertainties of ±1 °C, which seem reasonable for cave environments.

##### **`peral_2018`:**
Planktic foraminifera analyzed by [Peral et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2018.07.016), reprocessed by _Daëron & Gray_ (in review).

##### **`jautzy_2020`:**
Synthetic calcites analyzed by [Jautzy et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.7185/geochemlet.2021).

##### **`anderson_2021_lsce`:**
Slow-growing mammillary calcite from Devils Hole and Laghetto Basso analyzed at LSCE by [Anderson et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gl092069).

##### **`fiebig_2021`:**
Inorganic calcites analyzed by [Fiebig et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2021.07.012).

##### **`devils_laghetto_2023`:**

##### **`combined_2023`:**
Combined data set including all of the above.
